/**
 * <p>
 * The JAX-RS publisher uses a {@link ServiceTracker} to track all services. If one has an @Path, @Provider etc. 
 * annotation it will be published. In rare cases it's necessary to modify the filter for the tracker e.g. to only
 * publish resource starting with "com.foo.*".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To accomplish this you can register a {@link ResourceFilter} as an OSGi service. The JAX-RS publisher will prefer 
 * use this service to construct it's {@link ServiceTracker}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Please Note:</b> Right now the {@link ResourceFilter} service must be registered before the publisher bundle 
 * is started. Dynamic behavior may follow in future versions.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @see Filter

 * @since 4.0
